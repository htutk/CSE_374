printing "GoHuskies" with the following commands:
`echo, cat, ls, grep, !!`

echo:
`echo GoHuskies` 
This will print out "GoHuskies" in the std out.

cat:
`echo GoHuskies > GoHuskiesFile; cat GoHuskiesFile`
This will first write "GoHuskies" to the new file "GoHuskiesFile".
`;` will execute `cat GoHuskiesFile` which will output the content 
of "GoHuskiesFile". 

ls:
`touch GoHuskies; ls GoHuskies` 
`ls` can only prints out the names of files and directories. 
Thus, we must create a file named "GoHuskies" first by typing 
`touch GoHuskies`, which will create a file named GoHuskies.
The command `ls GoHuskies` will print out "GoHuskies" on the 
std output. Note that if "GoHuskies" file is not created, 
the `ls GoHuskies` command will output a "No such file" error.

grep:
`grep GoHuskies GoHuskiesFile`
Assuming the "GoHuskiesFile" is not deleted from "cat" part, 
this grep command will print out "GoHuskies" in red, noting that
the searched pattern has a match found.

!!:
`alias GoHuskies=""`
`GoHuskies`
`!!`
This double-bang operator executes the last command. However, 
while doing so, it prints out the command itself. To print out 
onlyt "GoHuskies", we must create an empty alias named "GoHuskies",
execute that aliased command first, then type in `!!` to execute 
the most recent command (in this case, it will be "GoHuskies" command
since it was executed most recently). The double-bang operator prints
out the command name "GoHuskies" and does the execution (which is 
nothing here), thus only print out the command name "GoHuskies".
