In problem 2, parse.sh, I chose to use HTML tags to easily identify
exactly 100 most popular websites. Since my main objective is to 
analyze these particular websites, grepping with just `http` will 
be highly inefficient. With HTML tags, I can pinpoint exactly where
the websites that I tend to scrape are located.
