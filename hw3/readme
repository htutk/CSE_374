In problem 2, parse.sh, I chose to use HTML tags to easily identify
exactly 100 most popular websites. Since my main objective is to 
analyze these particular websites, grepping with just `http` will 
be highly inefficient. With HTML tags, I can pinpoint exactly where
the websites that I tend to scrape are located.

NOTE: Since this script uses HTML tags, which is targeted to 
http://100bestwebsites.org/, it may not work with other HTML files.
For general collection of urls, grepping just `http` should get 
the job done.
