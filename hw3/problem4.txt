Q1: 
`set _label` command defines the name of x and y axes.
Then, it defines the range of x axis to be from 0 to 100 inclusive.
The name of the output eps file is set to be "scatterplot.eps".
From "results.txt", the scatter plot, which is defined by `points`,
is drawn using "columns" 1 and 3 with an empty title.

Q2:
There is no certain relationship between the popularity of a page 
and its index's byte size. The points are scattered almost randomly 
over the plot. Thus, our theory of the more popular sites have smaller
index byte size is proven false by this experiment.
